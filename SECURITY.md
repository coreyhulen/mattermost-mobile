Security
========

Safety and data security is of utmost priority for the Mattermost community. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in our code base, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Reporting security issues
-------------------------

**Please do not use GitHub issues for security-sensitive communication.**

Security issues in the community test server, any of the open source codebases maintained by Mattermost, or any of our commercial offerings should be reported via email to [responsibledisclosure@mattermost.com](mailto:responsibledisclosure@mattermost.com). Mattermost is committed to working together with researchers and keeping them updated throughout the patching process. Researchers who responsibly report valid security issues will be publicly credited for their efforts&mdash;if they so choose.

For a more detailed description of the disclosure process and a list of researches who have previously contributed to the disclosure program, see [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report/) on the Mattermost website.
